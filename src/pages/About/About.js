                        Born and raised in Turkey. I studied Business and Hotel Management at one of the biggest university in South of Turkey. And then came to United States back in 2015. It was a great experience as a front desk agent and as a supervisor at one of the best hotel in Fort Lauderdale, FL. It was an amazing feelings that my talents has been seen, all the way from overseas. After a year, contact ended, but my journey just started.
