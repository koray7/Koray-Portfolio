                    I'm resilient and disciplined in staying focused on completing my goals until my desired outcome is met, and I love going above and beyond that. I'm also a career driven person and I have a "lifetime learning" mindset. I'm a good team player, hardworking, positive and fully motivated person. Every role that I take in the company, I would love to add international perspectives and useful ideas on top of my role to make the job easier and effective.
